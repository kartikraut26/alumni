<h2>Ruia College Alumni Association (RCAA)</h2>
<P style="font-size:20px">With a view to maintaining a steadfast and lasting relationship with the Alma Mater, the Ruia Alumni Association was formed in 1963 under the able leadership of the Principal B Y Oke to give past students an opportunity to interact with their old friends and teachers and to give the college an opportunity to be acquainted with the achievements of its alumni.</P>
<P style="font-size:20px">In the earlier years, the activities of the Alumni Association were few and far between, but the Association received a fillip from the former Principal Late Prof A P Rao, at the time of the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the college.</p>
<P style="font-size:20px">In 2011, on the occasion of Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of Ruia College, RCAA presented its own website that allowed all those who have passed out of Ruia and have been a fundamental part of the Collegeâ€™s educational experience to revive their memories attached to Ruia. RCAA has initiated this alumni portal to extend the Ruia College family. The ex-students who have passed out of this institution now have the opportunity to meet and greet their classmates. The Alumni network is structured in such a fashion that, it provides a platform for communication as well as networking. One can find out about their batch mates, create groups, and form communities. The RCAA thus presents an opportunity for all RUIATES to relive their past memories with each other.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Main objectives of RCAA are as follows:<br>
a) To enable the Alumni members to retain their links with their Alma Mater and to revive old association with their college mates and teachers.<br><br>

b) To organise fund-raising programmes to help the college create necessary infrastructure or assist in other activities.<br><br>

c) To institute scholarships and grants for deserving students of the College for excellence in academics and other fields of activity.<br><br>

d) To promote the activities of Ruia College to the outside world and project its image as a premier institution in various fields of activity.<br><br>

e) To exchange ideas, spread knowledge and bring the benefit of experience of such outstanding and accomplished alumni to the students and staff of the college.<br><br>
